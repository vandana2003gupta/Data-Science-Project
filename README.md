# Data Science Disease Detection Project
An AI-powered disease detection system with an interactive Streamlit dashboard. This project integrates multiple machine learning models to predict health conditions and includes a Yoga Posture Corrector for wellness enhancement.

## 🔗 Live App
[Try it now on Streamlit] (https://disease0detection.streamlit.app)

## 📄 Overview

This healthcare application supports:
- 🧬 Diabetes Detection
- ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction
- 🧠 Parkinson’s Detection
- 🧩 Autism Screening (Under Development)
- 🧘 Yoga Posture Corrector

It allows users to input relevant medical data and receive predictions from trained ML models, while also offering a health-conscious yoga feature.
